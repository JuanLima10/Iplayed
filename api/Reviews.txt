Tomb Raider:
It has a good story. From a graphic point of view it is excellent. Lara's hair, the steam coming out of her mouth, her legs sinking into the snow, when she is shivering from the cold, you can see that she suffers from the low temperatures, increasing her desire of survival. The gaming angle is not always the best. There are many differences from Tomb Raider 2013

Hogwarts Legacy:
If you are a big fan of the Harry Potter saga, this game will be wonderful and very complete, full of references and good... It's incredible, stop watching the review and buy it now.

If you're not such a fan, buy it anyway, it's a great game and I doubt you'll regret it.

There's a lot of content with side missions, various spells and customization content in everything you can imagine, the feeling of progress in this game I particularly found very good, I'm trying to do everything that comes my way, and you can see how much I'm evolving and getting stronger, not to mention the amount of things that are released as I advance and this makes me want to explore and advance further and further to release even more things, always surprising me with something.

Sifu:
You punch teenager, punch fat, punch old man, punch DJ, punch family guy, whatever you have to punch, you punch! WHAT A WONDERFUL GAME!

Zelda BOTW:
Beautiful game, incredible gameplay and a simple and complete story, there's no way to say anything bad about this franchise, you simply can't go wrong with a Zelda's games.

AC II:
Ezio is perfect on this game he is a very good character and I love his frindship with Lonardo this game is awesome and with a amazing story.

FIFA 23:
I've never played such a buggy game in my life, it's a bug that comes from past fifas, it's unbelievable. Bug to start the game, in the menu, when the game starts, in the middle of the game, in any mode. The problem is that I still love this game.
